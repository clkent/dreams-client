Dream Recall at it's core is a dream journal, but it's also so much more. When you sign up you'll be automatically logged into your own custom Dream Desktop where you'll find the tools you need to record, revisit, and understand your dreams. Writing down your dreams as soon as you wake up dramatically increases your ability to remember details and it's what's in the details that really matter.

Understanding your dreams can be crucial to your emotional and mental health. Dreams are means by which we solve problems and deal with deep emotions and lingering thoughts. Help bring clarity to your dreams.

Let your Dream Desktop be the hub for your unconscious mind.

## Description of Key Parts of Project

After creation, your project should look like this:

```
my-app/
  README.md
  node_modules/
  package.json
  public/
    index.html
    favicon.ico
  src/
    App.css
    App.js
    App.test.js
    index.css
    index.js
    logo.svg
```

For the project to build, **these files must exist with exact filenames**:

- `public/index.html` is the page template;
- `src/index.js` is the JavaScript entry point.

You can delete or rename the other files.

You may create subdirectories inside `src`. For faster rebuilds, only files inside `src` are processed by Webpack.<br>
You need to **put any JS and CSS files inside `src`**, otherwise Webpack won’t see them.

Only files inside `public` can be used from `public/index.html`.<br>
Read instructions below for using assets from JavaScript and HTML.

You can, however, create more top-level directories.<br>
They will not be included in the production build so you can use them for things like documentation.

If you have Git installed and your project is not part of a larger repository, then a new repository will be initialized resulting in an additional `.git/` top-level directory.

### Client Folder Structure

In the project directory, you can run:

### Server Folder Structure

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

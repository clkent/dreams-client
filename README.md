Dream Recall at it's core is a dream journal, but it's also so much more. When you sign up you'll be automatically logged into your own custom Dream Desktop where you'll find the tools you need to record, revisit, and understand your dreams. Writing down your dreams as soon as you wake up dramatically increases your ability to remember details and it's what's in the details that really matter.

Understanding your dreams can be crucial to your emotional and mental health. Dreams are means by which we solve problems and deal with deep emotions and lingering thoughts. Help bring clarity to your dreams.

Let your Dream Desktop be the hub for your unconscious mind.

## Description of Key Parts of Project

The authorization and user creation happens in the auth and users actions and reducers connected to the signupForm and loginForm components and connected to their respective server side models. The journaling aspect of the project is very straight forward. There are post actions and a reducer which connect to the calendar, postForm, postFormContent, and postView components. The server side post endpoint manages the creation and deletion of posts.

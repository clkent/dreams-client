              <b>Dream Recall</b> provides you with so much more. When you sign
              up you'll be automatically logged into your own custom{' '}
              <b>Dream Desktop</b> where you'll find the tools you need to
              record, revisit, and understand your dreams. Writing down your
              dreams as soon as you wake up dramatically increases your ability
              to remember details and it's what's in the details that really
              matter.

              Understanding your dreams can be crucial to your emotional and
              mental health. Dreams are means by which we solve problems and
              deal with deep emotions and lingering thoughts. Help bring clarity
              to your dreams.
